           <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> Just a creepy little goth girl who enjoys all things cute and creepy. Even at a young age I had a strong<br>
                adoration for the strange and unusual, everything colorful and dark. It’s who I am, and I want to be able<br>
                to express myself creatively. I want to help break those stereotypes that goths can’t littles too and I<br>
                hope to inspire all of you to be yourselves 100%. I hope my art brings you the same happiness it does me.<br>

            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>
                I’ve always been a little artist, even at a young age, and everybody around me started to see my talent.
                Were amazed by how much time and effort I had put into every little art piece I created.
                I think one of the best moments of my life, revolving around art was when I was 16 years old
                and was entered into a local art competition. I remember how nervous I was, how nerve racking
                it was because this wasn’t art class anymore, this was the real thing, with real,
                genuine artists, and that scared me a little. All I could think was “I’m not good enough
                for this”, “my art isn’t that good”, "Nobody will like it” and for a while that’s what I kept
                telling myself and as it got closer to thedeadline to turn into 5 pieces of art I was lost, I
                had no inspiration till just one day it had struck me,and I sat the whole day at my little desk
                drawing away, scribbling, painting and coloring and ended up with 5 beautifully lined pieces,
                the colors mixed perfectly, not a single one of them had an imperfection. They were brilliant,
                colorful, dark, and well, me. I got them framed, and turned them on time the next day, and ended
                up having all of my pieces in the main hall along side paintings that looked like they came from
                Picasso, and that was when I was genuinely happy,knowing I belonged there. It felt so good to be
                recognized. Looking back, my art has growed a lot since then, and though I have a long way to go,
                I am very excited for the future

              <h3>My mission</h3>
              <p>
                  I don’t want to just express myself aesthetically but artistically as well. I want to be able to incorporate <br>
                  all things cute, creepy, and spooky into my art and have a little community who enjoys those things as well.<br>
                  I want to be able to inspire others, and share the same happiness art brings me, and to see the faces of my customers,<br>
                  to create original, unique commissions for such lovely people, that brings me so much joy, and it gives me motivation <br>
                  to continue working, to never give up, and that’s what I hope to show all of you. That you can do anything if you put <br>
                  your mind to it.<br>
